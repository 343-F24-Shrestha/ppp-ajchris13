                <p id="about">I am currently an undergraduate student at James Madison University. I major in computer science and have just
                              recently picked up a minor in data analytics. My greatest interest lies in robotics, more specifically, how AI
                              can influence technology to make actions in real time. I am also interested in using AI to manage large sets of
                              data.

                <p id="casual">Interests Outside of CS</p>
                <p id="casual-interests">Outside of the classroom, I normally spend most of my time playing games or playing basketball.
                                         I've also very recently taken an interest in volleyball (I'm not the best at it yet). When I'm
                                         playing basketball, I usually do so at UPark. It's a really nice facility that not really
                                         many people use. Outside of sports and more on the games side of things, I typically enjoy
                                         playing single player games that really get you engaged in the story. Something like
                                         Witcher III or Red Dead Redemption (1 and 2) come to mind. Those types of games are
                                         something that I can usually just sit down and enjoy hours of at a time because it's like
                                         I'm watching a TV Show. Speaking of TV shows, one show that I really recommend is Breaking
                                         Bad. Although most people have probably already seen it, if you haven't I really recommend
                                         taking the time to watch it. Extremely engaging show.
